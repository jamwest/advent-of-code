# Advent of Code Repository

This repository is dedicated to my attempts at solving the Advent of Code challenges each year. The Advent of Code is an annual event where participants solve a series of programming puzzles throughout the month of December. You can attempt these yourself at [advent of code.](https://adventofcode.com/)

## Structure

The repository is organized by year, with each year having its own directory. Inside each year's directory, you will find the solutions to the daily puzzles as well as any supporting code or resources.
