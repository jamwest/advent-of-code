# Advent of Code in Go

This year, I am attempting the Advent of Code using the Go programming language. Stay tuned for my solutions.

## Setup Instructions

1. Install Go: Follow the instructions on the [official Go website](https://golang.org/doc/install) to install Go on your machine.
2. Clone this repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
3. Navigate to the cloned repository: `cd <repository-name>`

## How to Run

To run a specific day's solution, navigate to the day's directory and run the Go file. For example, to run the solution for Day 1:

```bash
cd day1
go run main.go
```

I will be updating my progress here as I complete each day's challenge.
